2.  The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.
3.  The mean of variable ‘temp’ is 39.5821229.

## Make a scatterplot and describe it

Make a scatterplot using time_hour as x and temp as y; color points
using humid.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_lz2951_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Accordig top the scatterplot, from 2013-01-01 to 2013-01-15:

1.  The temperature went up and down within a single day because of
    sunrise and sunset.
2.  The temperature increased because of seasonal change.
3.  The air became dryer as temperature increased within a day.

## Export scatterplot

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.png")
```

# Problem 2

## Create a data frame

This data frame consists of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
random_sample = rnorm(10)
example_df = tibble(
  numeric_norm = random_sample,
  log_gt10 = random_sample > 0,
  char_vec = c("one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","ten"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("A","A","A","B","B","B","C","C","C","C"))
)
example_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    numeric_norm log_gt10 char_vec factor_vec
    ##           <dbl> <lgl>    <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1      0.626   TRUE     one      A         
    ##  2     -1.02    FALSE    two      A         
    ##  3      0.449   TRUE     three    A         
    ##  4      0.149   TRUE     four     B         
    ##  5     -0.468   FALSE    five     B         
    ##  6      0.00445 TRUE     six      B         
    ##  7      0.0177  TRUE     seven    C         
    ##  8      1.66    TRUE     eight    C         
    ##  9      0.0292  TRUE     nine     C         
    ## 10     -0.407   FALSE    ten      C

## Calculate the mean of each variable

``` r
mean_numeric = mean(pull(example_df, numeric_norm))
mean_log = mean(pull(example_df, log_gt10))
mean_char = mean(pull(example_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor = mean(pull(example_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

According to the results, the mean function works for numeric_norm which
is numeric variable and log_gt10 which is logical variable.

The mean of numeric_n is 0.1037224, the mean of log_gt10 is 0.7

## Convert variables

Apply as.numeric() function to three non-numeric variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(example_df, log_gt10))
as.numeric(pull(example_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(example_df, factor_vec))
```

According to the result, logical vector and factor vector could be
converted to numeric vector without warning while character vector could
not. I think it’s because R doesn’t have a rule for converting
characters of any form to numbers, but for logical and factor variables,
this rule exists:

- For logical variables, 0 refers to FALSE and 1 refers to TRUE
- For factor variable, R assigns ordinal numbers to factor levels.

I guess when I try to conduct mean() to a non-numeric variable vector,
this function firstly tries to convert variable to numeric variable,
that’s why I can get mean of a logical variable vector but I can’t get
it for a character vector. As for factor vector, although it can be
converted to a numeric variable, the mean of this numeric variable has
no statistical significance.
